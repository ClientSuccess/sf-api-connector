/**
 * An SObject is the fundamental catch-all object in Salesforce. Contacts, Leads, etc are all SObjects. An SObject has a
 * string type that defines whether or not it's a contact or lead. To be clear, when a Contact "is" an SObject, this
 * means that it literally is an instance of the SObject class, not an instance of some class that inherits from
 * SObject.
 *
 * SObjects have a type and a map of fields. The type is something like "Contact". This allows for organization-specific
 * custom types.
 *
 * The map of fields is String keyed and String valued. Certain fields may be custom fields (see the SObjectDescription
 * for that object type) and will have field names suffixed with __c, e.g. "HairColor__c".
 *
 * Fields in SalesForce have a type, such as boolean, string, or datetime, but we only have access to them as strings.
