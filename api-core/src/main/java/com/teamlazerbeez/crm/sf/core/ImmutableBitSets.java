     * The encoding used is strange: it is as if they created a stream of bits by iterating over each of the controlling
     * picklist options and writing a 1 if this entry is valid and a 0 otherwise. This has the effect of making the
     * first picklist entry represented by the high order bit in the first byte, instead of the low order as might be
     * expected. So, though the bytes are arranged naturally, the bits inside each byte are reversed.
