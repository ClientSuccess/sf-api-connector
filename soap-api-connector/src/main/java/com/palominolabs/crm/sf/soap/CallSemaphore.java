/**
 * A mechanism for limiting the number of concurrent calls for a given org. Salesforce only allows a limited number of
 * concurrent calls to be made. When that limit is breached, an UnexpectedErrorFault_Exception is thrown, which is too
 * vague to be useful as a means of catching that specific exception. So, to reduce the possibility of hitting the limit
 * (it can never be eliminated since other tools could be accessing that salesforce org), each PartnerConnection gets a
 * token every time it needs to make a call and releases it after the call.
 *
 * To allow for runtime tuning of the number of permits, a new object is initialized with 0 permits. The proper permit
 * limit must be set by calling setMaxPermits. setMaxPermits can subsequently be called safely at any point to adjust
 * the max number of permits allowed.
 *
 * New instances should be configured with setMaxPermits().
