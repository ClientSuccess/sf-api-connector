     * necessarily be bigger than the maxSize. In other words, this is a best-effor approach since field names are not
     * necessarily constrained.
     *
     * An alternate approach would be to throw an exception when a field name longer than maxSize is found, but this was
     * not done because there is a chance that the oversized field may still be accepted by Salesforce. There is not a
     * clear way of knowing how much of the 10,000 character limit will be used by the rest of the request, so we cannot
     * say for sure what size field name will or will not be allowed.
